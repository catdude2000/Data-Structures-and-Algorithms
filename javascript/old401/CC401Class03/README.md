# Challenge Title

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

Started with a mid point found using Math.floor(array.length/2). Then we made a floor loop that checked if mid was lower to equal or greater than the searchKey. Our code reflects trying to change the value of mid, which I don't think is possible in js, at least not in the way we did it. Maybe using a new array would work.
Time efficiency of O(n) and space of O(1).
